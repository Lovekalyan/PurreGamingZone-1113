                    PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG) is a multiplayer online battle royale
                    game developed by a PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of Korean publisher Bluehole.

                        There will be 100 players along with you. You will get on 
                        the plane and you have to be dropped in an island. And there is the map in which you will play.
                        After parachuting down from the plane, you have to loot things because you will have nothing 
                        in your hand. There may be problem if there are people on the corner of the map and they
                        don’t meet. To avoid this situation, after a few minutes a circle will emerge and you have 
                        to be inside the circle and it will start decreasing based on time. If you are outside the circle,
                        then you will loose your health. So in this your main objective is to loot and to be the last man 
                        standing. You can play solo, duo and squad. Their optimisation is not so great. Hope they will 
                        rectify that in the future.

                        Grand Theft Auto V takes you back to the infamous San Andreas, hailing back to the GTA game of the same name. 
                        The story follows the lives of three main characters - Michael, Trevor, and Franklin.
                        Each one has unique personality traits that will often get them into trouble.You can freely switch among
                        them in the GTA V campaign, selecting the primary objectives or side quests. The former propels you towards
                        the end of the storyline, while the latter gives you funds and experience to get better weapons and other 
                        items. If you’re into real estate and vehicles, you can use your amassed fortune to buy several of them in
                        the city.Of course, there’s the core crime theme, so you can resort to violence and theft to claim assets 
                        for free. Grand Theft Auto V is better suited to a mature audience, containing elements of sex, drugs, and
                        extreme violence. You’ll also need to make critical decisions during select parts of the story, which will 
                        affect the outcome.
